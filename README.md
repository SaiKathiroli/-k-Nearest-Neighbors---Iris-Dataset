# -k-Nearest-Neighbors---Iris-Dataset
This is my first machine learning project where I explore the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using the famous Iris dataset. The project involves building a predictive model, making predictions, and evaluating its accuracy.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: Utilized scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset.
Data Splitting: Employed the train_test_split function to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Creation: Implemented the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with a k-value of 4 using scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier.
Model Training: Trained the model on the training dataset.
Making Predictions: Demonstrated how to make predictions with the trained model, including a sample prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's accuracy on the test set and calculated accuracy metrics.
Outcome:
This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts, focusing on a fundamental algorithm and a well-known dataset. As I continue my journey in machine learning, I look forward to exploring more complex models and datasets.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding!
